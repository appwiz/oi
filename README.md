Oi!
==

Open source clone of the Yo app for iOS

Save the yo's for the bros. Oi! your mates instead. Fork this project to get a chance of 1 million $ investment to spend it all on cheap beer.

The 'Oi' sound is from [Sin Etuqueta - The Brews (NOFX Cover)](https://sinetiqueta.bandcamp.com/track/the-brews-nofx)


### Usage Instructions

The app uses `Parse.framework`, which has not been added to this repository. Download it from [parse.com](http://www.parse.com) and put in the Oi project directory.

You will also need a Parse.com account, and to create a new application there so you can get your own application ID and client key to put in the `PYMAppDelegate.m` file.

This app uses push notifications as its main feature, which you will have to set up. You can follow [this tutorial](https://www.parse.com/tutorials/ios-push-notifications) to set up iOS push notifications with Parse. Note that the iOS simulator cannot receive push notifications, so you will need an Apple Developer account to set up push notifications on your device.

### App Store
This app is available on the [App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/hk/app/oi!!!/id897987191?mt=8). Check it out!
